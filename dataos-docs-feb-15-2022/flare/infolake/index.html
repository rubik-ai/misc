<p>The story flow of this article is (THIS SECTION IS FOR INTERNAL CONSUMPTION ONLY) </p>
<p>What is preventing the usage of existing data platforms by business and non-technical users ?  </p>
<p>What have we done in DataOS to make it usable by everyone? What did we introduce to abstract out the technical protocols and need for programming languages ?  </p>
<p>How can users with even limited SQL skills make the most of DataOS ? </p>
<p>In a data-driven business world, for many organisations, a state-of-the-art data and analytics platform is no longer an option but a necessity. These platforms act as a central repository for enterprise-wide data and empowers businesses to translate data into business value. Over the last decade, these organisations have invested a lot in building best data platforms but have often failed in achieving true value from their data at rapid pace. One of the primary reasons for this is that the business users always depended on Technical teams for data because the data platforms demand programming and niche technical expertise. </p>
<p>While building DataOS, we had one core agenda in mind - it should be used intuitively by a wide range of users. This means DataOS should make it possible for all users to easily discover and analyze data within the platform, understand the context associated with data, such as column descriptions, history and lineage and derive insights from data with minimal dependencies on the data or IT team. </p>
<p>Data processing made easy with DataOS </p>
<p>Executing data processing jobs has remained a nightmare for data engineers and with DataOS we wanted to simplify this. To achieve this we have built our own data processing engine called ‘Rio’. DataOS® Rio allows data engineers to ingest both batch and stream data processing. Rio Flare is a library that simplifies writing and executing ETL jobs and is built on top of Apache Spark.  </p>
<p>Typically when you use spark, in data processing, you need to write programs in a programming language like Python,Java or Scala. This requires users to have prior knowledge of one of these programming languages. In DataOS, we have abstracted out the programming interface and turned it into declarative. Flare allows you to declare your Transformation steps in simple YAML configuration files and then runs it on DataOS® managed Spark Cluster.  </p>
<p>Example : For a data ingestion job users can simply declare the source system from where the data needs to be read, transformation logic in simple SQL syntax and final destination where the data needs to be written. DataOS Flare abstracts out all the complexities related to different storage system protocols and performs the job for you. </p>
<p>Screenshot showing details of input, output and steps in a sample data ingestion flare job </p>
<p>So, essentially, we have tried to take out programming languages as a necessary skill and made things easy by introducing SQL as the only required skills for users. Contrary to earlier, users can now work on Spark if they are equipped with SQL, which many users are comfortable with. </p>
<p>Data ingestion made easy with DataOS </p>
<p>One of the core pain points for data engineers during data ingestion is to ingest data from varied data storage systems. They need to learn and understand the underlying protocols of these systems and deploy these ingestion jobs as per the pre-configured protocols. Organisations these days, store data in multiple sources in varied formats. Now, imagine the time these data engineers spend on understandingRemember, we said that we have abstracted out the need for programming languages while writing data processing jobs, similarly we have abstracted out the concept of varied storage protocols for different storages. Let me explain it with an example.  </p>
<p>Organisations store data in Redshift using it as DataWarehouse, BigQuery, S3 as blob storage or Snowflake. Now all of these storage systems have different storage protocols, as in how can we query data from these storage systems. What we have essentially done with DataOS is, we have thoroughly understood the underlying technologies and protocols behind these storage systems and created one standard SQL way for users, so that they can query and access data from multiple data source systems. In DataOS, we have made this possible by introducing DataOS ‘Depots’. </p>
<p>More about DataOS Depots </p>
<p>DataOS depots enable Data Engineers to write data ingestion jobs irrespective of the source data storage systems. Depots abstract out the challenge of accessing data stored across varied storage systems. Depots contain connection details about the data source and destination systems and the information about the type of data storage systems. Depots encapsulates the complexity and surfaces a simple dataset address and users can access their data using SQL. Backend protocols pertaining to data accessibility of that source system becomes immaterial now.  </p>
<p>From an end user point of view, accessing a kafka topic or data from a big query table is one and the same. The back end technical protocols of these two will be abstracted and taken care of by DataOS depots. In the next section, let us briefly understand about SQL workbench that brings in immense data capabilities into DataOS. </p>
<p>DataOS workbench </p>
<p>DataOS Workbench is a SQL based query engine and allows data analysts to write complex SQL queries for managing, manipulating and analysing data in the database. Data analysts can use DataOS workbench to connect to multiple data sources and process SQL queries at rapid pace and scale. DataOS Rio(our inhouse data processing engine) handles these SQL queries to create tables or views. It is simple and easy to use.  </p>
<p>Want to query your data but not proficient at writing long SQL queries? It is no longer a problem with DataOS. Business users can use SQL studio which is a visual query builder and build even complex queries visually via drag-and-drop even without writing queries. Users need to just select which data you want to get, apply necessary functions and aggregations to them, configure sorting and filtering, and that’s all.  All of these can be done using an intuitively built user interface (UI), and users won’t need to type even a single line of code. How cool ! </p>
<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>Nowadays, almost all data teams are overwhelmed with data requests. They spend sleepless nights trying to make disparate data sets talk to each other, building and maintaining data pipelines, solving data quality and accessibility issues all by themselves. DataOS is one platform that is designed to make the life of data teams easy. DataOS’s intuitive and extensive features encourage users, irrespective of their technical and programming abilities, to experiment with their data. This reduces dependency of business teams on Data teams and improves time to insight drastically. </p>
<p>Along with many inbuilt features, DataOS also comes with a swift data processing engine and powerful workbench which require a minimal learning curve. Over the past 12 months, we’ve been working very closely with our beta customers to understand their data goals and showed them how DataOS can help them achieve data goals within 3-6 months.

<p>PRODUCT – DataOS </p>
<p>DataOS (Data Operating System) is a comprehensive data platform that abstracts out the entire complexities of data engineering by productizing it so that as a business, you can focus on driving value from data instead of managing data. </p>
<p>Status quo at several companies is that they are spending lot of time and money on data wrangling than on how to use the data. </p>
<p>DataOS provides entire data management in one product – everything from data ingestion, data governance, data quality, operationalizing data, data discoverability. </p>
<p>Current alternatives to get the capabilities provided by DataOS are very suboptimal. The most common available alternative is: </p>
<p>Custom build data ecosystem to power the data needs from ground-up by going to an SI (Accenture, Deloitte, etc.), taking a reference architecture, picking multiple vendors of point solutions for ingestion, catalog, quality, governance, processing. </p>
<p>These tools are built on different and old stacks that limits their capabilities and integration with other tools. </p>
<p>Sum of all these parts results in a very rigid architecture. </p>
<p>Inefficiencies experienced </p>
<p>Integrate Snowflake on top of existinf infrastructure would take a year. </p>
<p>Moving away from Snowflake to Redshift would take 2 or 3 quarters. </p>
<p>Data movement from Teradata on-prem to Teradata Cloud takes 2 years. </p>
<p>Spend millions of dollars in license fees for Snowflake, PowerBI, Alteryx, etc. and not able to take advantage of the functionalities of those products. </p>
<p>Creating each BI report/dashboard takes X weeks. </p>
<p>The main gap in the market is that the customers of the companies are expecting experiences that can be provided only with an agile and modern data ecosystem but companies do not have a way to achieve it with the status quo and available alternatives. </p>
<p>The rigidity of the data ecosystem and infrastructure that hinders the companies to adapt to dynamic business environment is the key problem that is solved by DataOS. </p>
<p>DataOS gives enterprises an agile data infrastructure and future-proofs their infrastructure for next 5-10 years. </p>

<p>Tips from the book: THE MOM TEST </p>
<p>Tips: </p>
<p>Talk about their life instead of your idea. </p>
<p>Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future. </p>
<p>Talk less and listen more. </p>
<p>Rules of Thumb when framing questions: </p>
<p>Opinions are worthless. </p>
<p>Anything involving the future is an over-optimistic lie. </p>
<p>People will lie to you if they think it’s what you want to hear. </p>
<p>You're shooting blind until you understand their goals. </p>
<p>Watching someone do a task will show you where the problems and inefficiencies really are, not where the customer thinks they are. </p>
<p>If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours. </p>
<p>People stop lying when you ask them for money. </p>
<p>While it’s rare for someone to tell you precisely what they’ll pay you, they’ll often show you what it’s worth to them. </p>
<p>In a B2B context, know where the money comes from </p>

<p>Option B:  A fully-integrated platform that allows you to programmatically manage and operationalize all your legacy and cloud data. </p>
<p>Option C:  The connective tissue for your data, ML and analytics infrastructure </p>
<p>Option D:  An operating system to power your entire data lifecycle. </p>
<p>Option E : DataOS is the operating system for a new generation of data,ML and analytics infrastructure.  </p>
<p>DataOS is the operating system powering a new generation of data and analytics infrastructure. It is the connective tissue between your legacy and cloud data sources delivering quality, governed, secure and reliable data in real-time. Democratize and simplify access to data and insights for technical and business users in your team with DataOS. </p>
<p>DataOS policies allow organizations to authorize users, employees and third parties to access company data in a manner that meets security, privacy and compliance requirements.</p>
<p>Access Policy  </p>
<p>Access policy is a security measure which is put in place to regulate the individuals that can view, use, or have access to a restricted DataOS environment/resource.A This is implemented by tags. For example a user with a tag 'operator' can access secrets or specific Depots to connect to data. </p>
<p>Data Policies  </p>
<p>These policies are global policies available in the system which contains all the column level policy. Using these policies, you can:
Mask the data or 
Filter the data.  </p>
<p>Masking and filtering strategies can be defined in the YAML files. For example, PII data can be shown with appropriate mask, replacing with "####" string or with some hash function. You can filter the data based on tags such as some users can not see ' Florida' region data.  </p>
<p>The following examples show what the masked data might look like after the masking policy is applied.
